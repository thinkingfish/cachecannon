## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Rename valkey-bench binary to valkey-lab
- Add product page (docs/index.html)

## [0.0.7] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- Fix viewer percentile charts by bumping metriken-query to 0.2.0

## [0.0.6] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- Add `valkey-bench` CLI binary as an alias for `cachecannon`
- Add separate `valkey-bench` DEB/RPM packages for standalone installation

## [0.0.5] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- Fix prefill stall caused by idle connections spin-looping without
  yielding to the cooperative scheduler, starving connections with
  pending responses

## [0.0.4] - 2026-02-26

### Changed
- Add fire/recv pipelining to RESP and Memcache workers, honoring
  `pipeline_depth` config (previously ignored for these protocols)
- Update ringline dependencies to c084d5c (fire/recv API)
- Simplify on_result callbacks to record latency only; counter metrics
  now go through the unified `record_counters()` path

### Fixed
- Fix tag-release workflow to create PR for dev version bump

## [0.0.3] - 2026-02-25

### Changed
- Vendor sharded counter module, removing external crucible dependency
- Update ringline dependencies to 1f08cac

## [0.0.2] - 2026-02-24

### Changed
- Update ringline dependencies to 0f76448
- Momento latency metrics now use the on_result callback pattern, matching
  valkey/memcache/ping protocols

## [0.0.1] - 2026-02-21

Initial release. Extracted from the [crucible](https://github.com/brayniac/crucible)
benchmark module into a standalone tool.

### Added
- High-performance cache protocol benchmarking with io_uring via ringline
- Protocol support: Valkey/Redis (RESP), Memcache (ASCII), Momento, Ping
- Multiplexed and pipelined request modes
- Kernel SO_TIMESTAMPING for precise latency measurement
- Precheck phase to verify connectivity before warmup
- Prefill phase to populate cache before benchmarking
- Configurable workload: keyspace, value size, command mix (get/set/delete)
- Rate limiting support
- Cluster mode with CLUSTER SLOTS discovery and redirect handling
- TLS support for all protocols
- Metrics exposition via Parquet snapshots and HTTP endpoint
- Built-in results viewer with web UI
- APT and YUM package repositories
- CI: clippy, tests, Momento integration tests, Valkey/Redis TLS tests
